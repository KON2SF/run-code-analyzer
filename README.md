The `run-code-analyzer` GitHub Action scans your code for violations using
[Salesforce Code Analyzer](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/platform/salesforce-code-analyzer/overview), uploads the results as an artifact, and displays
the results as a job summary.

# Version: v2
The `forcedotcom/run-code-analyzer@v2` GitHub Action is based on [Salesforce Code Analyzer v5.x](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/platform/salesforce-code-analyzer/guide/code-analyzer.html), which is the `code-analyzer` Salesforce CLI plugin.

## v2 Inputs
* <b>`run-arguments`</b> *(Default: `--view detail --output-file sfca_results.json`)*
  * Specifies the flags passed to the `code-analyzer run` command.
    * For a full list of valid flags for the `code-analyzer run` command, see the [code-analyzer Command Reference](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_cli_reference.meta/sfdx_cli_reference/cli_reference_code-analyzer_commands_unified.htm).
  * The stdout text from the `code-analyzer run` command is written to the [GitHub workflow run logs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/monitoring-and-troubleshooting-workflows/monitoring-workflows/using-workflow-run-logs).
  * Each output file specified by a `--output-file` (or `-f`) flag is included in the ZIP archive [GitHub workflow run artifact](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/managing-workflow-runs-and-deployments/managing-workflow-runs/downloading-workflow-artifacts) for you to download.
* <b>`results-artifact-name`</b>  *(Default: `salesforce-code-analyzer-results`)*
  * Specifies the name of the ZIP archive [GitHub workflow run artifact](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/managing-workflow-runs-and-deployments/managing-workflow-runs/downloading-workflow-artifacts) where the results output files are uploaded.
* <b>`github-token`</b>
  * When this action is run against a pull request, you can provide a GitHub token, which is used to create a review of the pull request. The review specifies how many violations were found (both in the project as a whole and in changed files) and links to the action summary page.
  * This token must have write permissions for pull requests.
    * You can use the default GitHub token stored as the `GITHUB_TOKEN` secret, as long as you also use the job-level `permissions` property to give that token write access for pull requests.

## v2 Outputs
* `exit-code`
  * The Salesforce Code Analyzer execution exit code.
* `num-violations`
  * The total number of violations found.
* `num-sev1-violations`
  * The number of Critical (1) severity violations found.
* `num-sev2-violations`
  * The number of High (2) severity violations found.
* `num-sev3-violations`
  * The number of Medium (3) severity violations found.
* `num-sev4-violations`
  * The number of Low (4) severity violations found.
* `num-sev5-violations`
  * The number of Info (5) severity violations found.
* `review-id`
  * If the action created a pull request review, this is its ID.

This `run-code-analyzer@v2` action doesn't exit your GitHub workflow when it finds violations. We recommend that you add a subsequent step to your workflow that uses the available outputs to determine how your workflow should proceed.

## Environment Prerequisites
The [Salesforce Code Analyzer v5.x](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/platform/salesforce-code-analyzer/guide/code-analyzer.html) and its bundled engines can each have their own set of requirements in order to run successfully. We recommend that you set up your GitHub runner(s) with this software:
* `node` version 20.9.0 or greater
  * Required by all engines.
* `java` version 11 or greater
  * Required by some engines, such as `pmd` and `cpd`, unless those engines have been explicitly disabled in your `code-analyzer.yml` configuration file.
* `python` version 3.10 or greater
  * Required by some engines, such as `flowtest`, unless those engines have been explicitly disabled in your `code-analyzer.yml` configuration file.

# Version: v1
The `forcedotcom/run-code-analyzer@v1` GitHub Action is based on [Salesforce Code Analyzer v4.x](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/platform/salesforce-code-analyzer/guide/code-analyzer-3x.html), which is the original `@salesforce/sfdx-scanner` Salesforce CLI plugin.

**Note:**
> Starting May 1, 2025, we no longer support v4.x of Code Analyzer. You should use v5.x of Code Analyzer instead. See https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/platform/salesforce-code-analyzer/guide/code-analyzer.html. For information about migrating from v4.x to v5.x, see https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/platform/salesforce-code-analyzer/guide/migrate.html.

> We recommend that you use the `run-code-analyzer@v2` GitHub Action, because it's based on v5.x. (see [above](./README.md#run-salesforce-code-analyzer---github-action))

* <b>`run-command`</b>  *(Default: `run`)*
  * Specifies the Salesforce Code Analyzer command to run.<br/>
    Possible values are: *`run`, `run dfa`*.<br/>
  * For more info on Code Analyzer, read our [documentation](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/platform/salesforce-code-analyzer/overview).
* <b>`run-arguments`</b>  *(Default: `--normalize-severity`)*
  * Specifies arguments passed to the specified `run-command` value.<br/>
    The arguments provided must include *`--normalize-severity`*.<br/>
    To control the output file included in the uploaded artifact, specify an output file with the *`--outfile`* argument.<br/>
    If an output file isnâ€™t specified, results are written to GitHub workflow run logs and a
    *SalesforceCodeAnalyzerResults.json* file is included in the uploaded artifact.
  * For a full list of acceptable arguments, read the appropriate Command Reference:
    * [sf scanner run](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_cli_reference.meta/sfdx_cli_reference/cli_reference_scanner_commands_unified.htm#cli_reference_scanner_run_unified)
    * [sf scanner run dfa](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_cli_reference.meta/sfdx_cli_reference/cli_reference_scanner_commands_unified.htm#cli_reference_scanner_run_dfa_unified)
* <b>`results-artifact-name`</b>  *(Default: `code-analyzer-results`)*
  * Specifies the name of the zip archive job artifact where the results output file is uploaded.

## v1 Outputs
* `exit-code`
  * The Salesforce Code Analyzer execution exit code.
* `num-violations`
  * The total number of violations found.
* `num-sev1-violations`
  * The number of normalized high-severity violations found.
* `num-sev2-violations`
  * The number of normalized medium-severity violations found.
* `num-sev3-violations`
  * The number of normalized low-severity violations found.

This `run-code-analyzer` action will not exit your GitHub workflow when violations are found. Instead, we recommend adding a subsequent step to your workflow that uses these outputs to determine how your workflow should proceed.
